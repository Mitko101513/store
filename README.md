# Video Store Application

This repository contains a Spring Boot application that can be easily run as a JAR (Java Archive) file. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- Maven 3.6.3 or later (for building the project)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd store
    ```

3. **Build the project using Maven:**
